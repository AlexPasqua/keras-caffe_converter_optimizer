# Keras-Caffe converter and optimizer
***This project is a NNs converter between Keras and Caffe (in both directions) and it includes pruning functionalities in Keras.***

## Conversion:
This tool allows you to convert NNs from Caffe to Keras and back.

**Caffe** is known to be the most efficient framework for developing and deploying NNs. It's made to work with C++, a Python API exists, but it's still a bit uncomplete and not very well documented.

**Keras**...
